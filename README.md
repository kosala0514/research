PYTHON TEACHER 

Overview
Python Teacher is a task recommendation system designed to assist beginner students in learning Python. The project aims to provide a structured and personalized learning path by recommending tasks and exercises tailored to the individual's skill level and progress. Leveraging the power of Python and educational resources, Python Teacher aims to make the learning experience engaging, interactive, and effective.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

1. **Python**: Python Teacher is built using Python. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

    ```bash
    # Verify your Python installation
    python --version
    ```

2. **Virtual Environment (Optional, but recommended)**: It is good practice to set up a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies.

    ```bash
    # Install virtualenv (if not already installed)
    pip install virtualenv

    # Create a virtual environment
    virtualenv venv

    # Activate the virtual environment
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On Unix or MacOS
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Django**: Python Teacher uses the Django web framework. Install Django using the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install Django
    ```

4. **Git (Optional)**: If you plan to clone the repository using Git, make sure Git is installed on your machine. You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads/).

    ```bash
    # Verify your Git installation
    git --version
    ```

5. **Dependencies**: Install project dependencies using the requirements file.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6. **Database Setup**: Python Teacher uses SQLite as the default database. No additional setup is required. If you prefer to use another database like PostgreSQL, update the `DATABASES` configuration in the `settings.py` file accordingly. (You should add the “Initial system questionnaires” file data to the “pre_test” table in DB)

7. **Web Browser**: Ensure you have a modern web browser to access the application.

Now you're ready to set up and run Python Teacher on your local machine!
